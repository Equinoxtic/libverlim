#LibVerlim 

A minimal console application library for C++

"In regards of this project, I wanted to make an revisioned version of the `heaval` framework. I did this because `heaval` was a scuffed library and it wasn't fun to code, and this is coming from the owner who has made it himself." ~ *Vertic*

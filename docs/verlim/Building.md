# Building the LibVerlim demo from source

* Building `libverlim` from source does not require any additional libraries.
* You just need to have:
	+ GCC/G++ installed
	+ CMake installed
	+ Make installed
* You will also need [Powershell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) for `WIN32` directives.

First, git clone the resources for LibVerlim.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Equinoxtic/res
```

If you have the console already running, you can run:

```
> res-install
```

To start building, type ``./build.sh`` or ``.\build.ps1`` for Windows users.

To run, type ``./run.sh`` or ``.\run.ps1`` for Windows users.
